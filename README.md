**Distributed NoSQL Triple Store Implementation**

Developed a distributed NoSQL triple store system to efficiently store and query TSV (triples: subject-predicate-object) data. Key aspects of the project include:

- **System Design:** Architected a distributed system using a client-server model with independent nodes, each hosting different data processing frameworks (MongoDB, MySQL, Hive) to demonstrate flexibility and interoperability.
- **Triple Management:** Utilized state-based objects to represent and manage triples, ensuring efficient tracking of changes and timestamps.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, MySQL, Hive, MongoDB, NoSQL.

This project highlights skills in distributed systems design, NoSQL databases, and advanced data management techniques.
